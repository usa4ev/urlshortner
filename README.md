# url shortener

It's my first bootcamp progect, so it is only made to practice golang. Many things in this project make little sense from production perspective or may be incomplete and are made only for me to get familiar with some basic concepts.

This project iplements http and grpc servers for url shortening with simple basic authorization and jwt sessions. 

The service may use in-memory or psql storage.
